<span style="color:white">## Education</span>

* **Currently:** PhD Student, Computer Engineering (Arizona State University)
* 2017-2018: M.S. Degree, Computer Engineering (UFRGS, Brazil)
* 2013-2017: B.S. Degree, Computer Engineering (UFRGS, Brazil)

<span style="color:white">## Work Experience</span>

* **Currently:** PhD Student / Research Assistant @ ASU
  * Working on the development of a full custom chip, which integrates multiple different dedicated hardware accelerators, executing simultaneously. This is a large scale project, involving a lot of researchers, but I am particularly assigned to tasks like RTL generation and communication channels/protocols. In addition to that, I am also working on adding features to an existing rad-hard processor’s Verilog, as well as verifying its functionality using different hierarchical granularities.

* 2017-2018: M.S. Student / Research Assistant @ UFRGS
  * Researcher with specialization in reliability and fault tolerance of FPGA and SoC components under harsh conditions, such as radiation-rich environments. The main focus of my research has been to evaluate the behavior of Artificial Neural Networks, used in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and space missions, most often for real-time image processing. I’ve also been working on proposing out-of-the-box selective hardening techniques in order to improve the overall system reliability with very low overhead in terms of resources and power. The obtained results have been presented in international conferences as well as published in IEEE journals.
  
* 2015-2017: B.S. Student / Research Assistant @ UFRGS
  * As an undergraduate student, the focus of my research was to evaluate the reliability of simple Artificial Neural Networks, used for Pattern Recognition and Linear Regression, implemented in FPGA. The obtained results were presented in IEEE conferences.

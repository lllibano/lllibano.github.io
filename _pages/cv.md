## <span style="color:white">Education</span>

* **Currently:** PhD Student, Computer Engineering (Arizona State University)
* 2017-2018: M.S. Degree, Computer Engineering (UFRGS, Brazil)
* 2013-2017: B.S. Degree, Computer Engineering (UFRGS, Brazil)

## <span style="color:white">Work Experience</span>

* **Currently:** PhD Student / Research Assistant @ ASU
  * I am currently working on novel architectures for neural networks on FPGAs/ASICs, targeting radiation hardness, higher performance and lower power consumption, as well as on the development of auxiliary tools that enable a seamless transition from training frameworks (such as TensorFlow) to high quality RTL descriptions. In addition to that, I am involved on the development of a full custom chip, which integrates multiple different dedicated hardware accelerators, executing simultaneously. This is a large scale project, in which a number of researchers are collaborating, but I am particularly assigned to tasks like RTL generation and communication channels/ protocols. Furthermore, I am also working on adding architectural features to an existing rad-hard processor’s Verilog, and verifying its functionality using different hierarchical granularities.

* Summer 2019: Intern / Student @ LANL
  * The experience at LANL was very unique, in the sense that I was able to do a lot of hands-on work with different types of radiation experiments (neutron generators for evaluating SEEs, gamma cells for evaluating TID effects, and laser sources for evaluating architectural vulnerabilities). At the same time, I have learned a lot from the theoretical stand point, as I have attended more than 50 hours of classes and lectures, from world-renowned researchers on a number of very relevant topics, ranging from particle physics, radiation testing methodologies, high-performance computing, space applications and beyond. Particularly, I have evaluated the impact of reducing the floating-point precision on neural networks in FPGAs, both in terms of accuracy and radiation sensitivity.

* 2017-2018: M.S. Student / Research Assistant @ UFRGS
  * Researcher with specialization in reliability and fault tolerance of FPGA and SoC components under harsh conditions, such as radiation-rich environments. The main focus of my research has been to evaluate the behavior of Artificial Neural Networks, used in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and space missions, most often for real-time image processing. I’ve also been working on proposing out-of-the-box selective hardening techniques in order to improve the overall system reliability with very low overhead in terms of resources and power. The obtained results have been presented in international conferences as well as published in IEEE journals.
